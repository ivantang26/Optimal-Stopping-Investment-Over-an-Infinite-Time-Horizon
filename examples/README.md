# OptiStop Examples Roadmap

This folder contains a full notebook set aligned with the 4-sprint PRD roadmap.

## Notebook sequence

1. `01_sprint1_foundation.ipynb`
   - Analytical McDonald-Siegel baseline
   - Parameter sweeps for trigger sanity checks

2. `02_sprint2_primal_engine.ipynb`
   - Grid + FDM + PSOR primal obstacle workflow
   - Numerical convergence against analytical trigger

3. `03_sprint3_dual_kinked.ipynb`
   - Non-smooth kinked utility
   - Dual transformation and primal recovery
   - Boundary shift interpretation

4. `04_sprint4_analytics_viz.ipynb`
   - Value/payoff and trigger plots
   - Sensitivity heatmap over drift-volatility space
   - Path overlay and export tables for reporting

## Run order

Run notebooks in numeric order. They are designed to build narrative and technical depth from baseline theory to report-ready outputs.
